# Emergence of novel SARS-CoV-2 variants in the Netherlands
This is the repository to accompany our publication, "Emergence of novel SARS-CoV-2 variants in the Netherlands" in *Scientific Reports*. In this repository, you can find the scripts we used to conduct a study of SARS-CoV-2 genomes to explore the viral population diversity in the Netherlands, within a global context. Our work lends insight into the genetic variation of SARS-CoV-2 in the later stages of the pandemic in April and early May.
